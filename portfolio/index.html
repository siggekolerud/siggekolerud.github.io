                </h3>
                <p>
                    This was one of my first projects where we created a website for a fictional
                    flower shop named Delikat-Flora. It features a modern and clean design, with a focus
                    on a flower delivery service, allowing users to put in a postalcode and see if the shop delivers to it.

                <p>
                    Fjellporten was the second project I worked on and this is also a website for a fictional
                    company that rents out cars for trips to the mountains. The website features different tabs that show the different car types and
                    models available to rent.

                <p>
                    This is a project that I didn't start but continued working on after another team had started it.
                    It shows a monitor screen in the school cafeteria that displays the school health staff and sometimes information for
                    upcoming events at the high school.
